A user interface will appears. Now follow these steps:

1. Choose “ mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail” and press ENTER.
2. Enter system mail. It’s your choice, you can choose any. I am using “ubuntu”.
3. Then it will ask you to enter IP addresses to listen on incoming SMTP connections. Leave it as it is.
4. Other destinations will be same as that of system mail name. If it is not, then enter system mail name which was ubuntu in my case.
5. Leave the “machines to relay mail” empty.
6. Now it will ask you for IP address or host name of the outgoing smarthost. Enter “smtp.example.com::587″. Where example refers to gmail, yahoo or any other mail service and 587 is port number.
7. Then it will ask you, if you want to hide local mail name in outgoing mail? Choose “No”.
8. Then it will ask you, if you want to keep number of DNS-queries minimal? Choose “No”.
9. Keep delivery method for local mail default, i.e; mbox format in /var/mail/.
